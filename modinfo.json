	"name": "TiktaalikDreamings Realistic Weapon Pack",
	"description": "Intended to add some vaguely more realistic weapons from history instead of the very fantasy cliche things in the game.  Weights will be lower, in some cases by a lot, and fatigue use will be lower as well.  But those will be offset by damage reductions.  Grotesque oversized weapons make little sense vs humans, but those fantasy weapons have a use vs dragons after all.\nAt the moment contains only a single handed 12-13th century arming sword and a later greatsword based on the Gallowglass mercenary styles.",
	"changeNote": "experimenting with pillar assets which won't show anywhere and just bloat out the mod, plus new substance based texture for the 1H axe",
